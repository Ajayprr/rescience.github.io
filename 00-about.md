# Journal Philosophy

If computer science offers a large set of tools for prototyping, writing,
running, testing, validating, sharing and replicating results, computational
science still lags behind. In the best case, authors may provide the sources of
their research as a compressed archive and feel confident their research is
replicable. But this is not exactly
true. [Buckheit & Donoho (1995)](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~wavelab/Wavelab_850/wavelab.pdf)
explained almost 20 years ago that, *an article about computational result is
advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software
environment, code and data that produced the result*. The computational part in
computational sciences implies the use of computers, operating systems, tools,
frameworks, libraries and data. This leads to such a large number of
combinations (taking into account the version for each component) that the
chances to have the exact same configuration as one of your colleagues are
nearly zero. This draws consequences in our respective computational approaches
in order to make sure that computational research can be actually and
faithfully replicated.

Re**Science** is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research
and encourages the explicit replication of already published research,
promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the
original research is reproducible. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing
chain is radically different from any other traditional scientific
journal. Re**Science** lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/ReScience/) where
each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations
and tests. Each submission takes the form of a pull request that is publicly
reviewed and tested in order to guarantee that any researcher can re-use it. If
you ever replicated computational results from the literature in your research,
Re**Science** is the perfect place to publish your new implementation.
