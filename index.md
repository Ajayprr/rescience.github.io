## Reproducible Science is good. Replicated Science is better.

Re**Science** is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research
and encourages the explicit [replication](faq) of already published research,
promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the
original research is [reproducible](faq).

To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from
other traditional scientific journals. Re**Science** lives on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ReScience/) where each new implementation of a
computational study is made available together with comments, explanations and
tests. Each submission takes the form of a pull request that is publicly
reviewed and tested in order to guarantee that any researcher can re-use it. If
you ever replicated computational results from the literature in your research,
Re**Science** is the perfect place to publish your new implementation.

Re**Science** is collaborative by design. Everything can be forked and
modified. Don't hesitate to [join us](faq) and to [become a reviewer](https://github.com/ReScience/ReScience/issues/27).
